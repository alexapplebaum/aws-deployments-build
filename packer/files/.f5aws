### Credentials ###
# This SSH key is used to login to all the deployed hosts in EC2
# It must exist in the AWS region you are using for testing.
# Go to AWS Console - EC2 -> Network & Security -> Key Pairs (Create or Import)  
ssh_key = ~/.ssh/<your_aws_key_here>.pem

# A seperate admin user account for the REST API will be created on BIG-IP 
# during the provisioning process with these credentials 
# NOTE: For simplicity, we also use this password for the default admin user

# These are the AWS keys that will be placed on the BIGIP if there's a cluster.
# (ex. These are used to reassign secondary IPs associated with VIPs, change route tables, etc)
# Best Practice is using separate keys for BIGIP IAM user with limited permissions to modify those network elements
#
# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_IAM.html
# Otherwise, if using a test account, you can set the same keys you have configured for BOTO environment
# If you are NOT testing a cluster, you can just leave them as empty quotes

# WARNING: If populating the f5_aws_XXXX_keys above, please ensure you use 
# disposable keys and use a STRONG password for bigip_rest_password 
# as these systems will be publicly available and you don't want to risk compromising these keys
